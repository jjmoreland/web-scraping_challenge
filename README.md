# web-scraping_challenge

For this challegne, objectives are to indentify HTML elements on a web page (id and class attributes), and use information to extract data via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup.  

Once information is scraped, additional insights can be made using previously learned code.  

Challenge is split into 2 deliverables:  

## Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
--part_1_mars_news.ipynb

## Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
--part_2_mars_weather.ipynb
